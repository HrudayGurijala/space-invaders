# Documenting Everything

## Description

Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art) using barebones 2D graphics libraries such as SDL, SFML, and Pygame.

### Day One

The focus for Day One was getting familiar with **Pygame** and defining basic shapes, movements, and understanding the **game loop**. The goal was to set up a simple framework for rendering, handling input, and managing basic interactions within the game world.

Key activities on Day One:
- Set up Pygame and created a window.
- Defined basic shapes (rectangles, circles) and moved them on the screen.
- Implemented basic movement controls (keyboard input).
- Built the basic structure for the game loop (rendering, updating, handling input).

### Day Two

## Things I Want to Learn

- Drawing to the screen.
- Handling user input.
- Game loop.
- Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., factory pattern).
- State machines for enemy AI.
- Playing sound.
- Using shaders.
- Networking for online features.
